Quick yellowpages scraper

Made in less than 2 hours, and then abandoned 

## Test usage 
~~~~
python3 main.py "https://www.yellowpages.com/search?search_terms=security+systems&geo_location_terms=Minot%2C+ME"
~~~~
Will output a test.csv file in your directory with entries for each organic search result in the result page.
test.csv structure: 

'YP page URL | Company name | Phone number | Categories | Street Address | Town/City | Zip | State | Business URL' 


So really just a test for the scraper function.
